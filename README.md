## About

A program that was developed to help people learn morse code as well as test their understanding. The program is simple and easy to use. It is also easy to use in a classroom environment as well as in a home environment.

## MVP

Create a webpage that allows users to input english and get a more code output, and input morse code and get an english output

Must support the alphabet, spaces, numbers.

Must give user feedback when they input unsupported characters.

Must be able to translate both ways.

Project must use javascript modules to seperate dom logic from vanilla js logic.

Can use react, or vanilla js.

Functions you write must be unit tested (you won't be able to write unit tests for function that interact with the dom).

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- Javascript
- Jest

## Design Considerations 

- I wanted to indicate clearly whether we were generating morse code or translating it into the english alphabet.
- I wanted to have a button which enabled altnerating between generating and translating
- I wanted it to be mobile friendly
- I wanted to style it in such a fashion that it looked historically relevant.
